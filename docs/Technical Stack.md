## Implementation
All the requried services are developed using python script and deployed as linux daemon services.

### Collectors

- **MtLinki Collector**
    - **Static Collector** - This service collects all new data from the MtLinki mongodb database for the 16 static parameter group.

    - **Dynamic Collector** - This service collects all new data from the MtLinki mongodb database for the 1 dynamic (servo and spindle load) parameter group.

- **Lasser Cladding Collector** - This service collects data from the laser cladding machine from its log files.

- **Journal Grinding Collector** - This service collects all new data from the journal grinding machine from its log files.

### Anomaly Detection

The anomaly detection for cnc machines are implemeted as part of the collector services.

- **Static Parameters** - The anomaly detection for the 16 parameter groups are part of the static collector service and it works by simply {==checking if the current value of the parameters are within the normal working range==}.

- **Dynamic Parameters** - The anomaly detection for the 1 parameter group (Servo and Spindle load) are part of the dynamic collector service and {==it works using Kruskalâ€“Wallis one-way analysis of variance algorithm==}. This method compares the signal values for a new cycle with a reference signal, for any anomaly.

### Part Count Monitor

The machine part counts (for 59 cnc machines) are monitored from the parameter "para name". Once the reset button on the machine controller is pressed, the part count will be reset to zero. But to get a cumulative part count, we store the last part count value before the reset button was pressed, then whenever the part count is increased, the actual part count would be the part count before the press of reset button plus the current part count value. The formula for that is given below:

$$
\operatorname{} P_{A} = P_{Current} + P_{Cumulative}        ....... 1
$$


Where,
P~A~ --> Actual Part Count

P~Current~ --> Current Part Count

P~Cumulative~ --> Cumulative Part Count Before Press of Reset Button

### Abnormality Reports

Different abnormalities are generated as an excel report as soon as they are recorded, and stored in a common location (Where the email alerts service will be looking for new report), these files will be deleted as soon as they are sent as email alerts by the email alerts services. The following things will create an abnormality report:

- **Static Parameter Abnormality** - This will be recorded by the static collector as soon as {==any parameter goes beyond it's normal working range==}. A sample report is shown below.

- **Dynamic Parameter Abnormality** - This will be recorded by the dynamic collector as soon as {==any set of parameters belonging to a specific cycle is not similar to it's reference signal==}. A sample report is shown below.

- **Part Count Alert** - This will be recorded by the part count monitor as soon as {==any component of a machine exceeded it's part count limit and needs to be replaced==}. A sample report is shown below.

### Database

From the requirements and nature of current system, we've choosen timescale db as the database to store all the data. The entity relationship diargrams of all the table of the database is shown below:

### 4/8 Hour Summary Report

Every 4 hour (Starting from 5:30 AM) a summary of machines that were under abnormal condition are generated and saved as report in the directory 'directory location'. These reports are used by email service to send email alerts. A sample of the report is shown below:

![Four Hour Summary](./images/4_hour_summary.png){ align=center }

### Email Alerts

An email service is deployed, which looks for new reports in the directory 'directory' every 5 second. As soon a new report is created in this directory it will be sent as email and deleted.

### Back End

The back end is developed with python and fastapi framework, and ponyorm. The structure of the backend and description of the files and folders are explained in detail in the *Code Explanation* section.

### Front End

The front end is developed with html, css, javascript and react framework. The structure of the frontend and description of the files and folders are explained in detail in the *Code Explanation* section.
