# OPC UA

## Introduction

OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) is a device-to-device communication protocol for industrial automation and industrial IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It is a widely adopted and standardized protocol designed to enable seamless and secure communication between various devices and systems in industrial environments.

Here are some key aspects of OPC UA:

1. **Architecture:** OPC UA follows a client-server architecture, where one or more clients communicate with one or more servers. Clients can request data, perform operations, and subscribe to real-time data from servers. Servers provide access to data and services and respond to client requests.

2. **Interoperability:** OPC UA is designed to facilitate interoperability among devices and systems from different vendors. It provides a common framework for communication and data exchange, ensuring that different devices can communicate with each other regardless of the underlying hardware, operating system, or programming language.

3. **Data Modeling:** OPC UA allows for flexible and extensible data modeling. It defines a standardized information model that enables the representation of various types of data, such as process data, alarms, events, historical data, and more. This modeling capability allows for consistent and meaningful data exchange between different systems.

4. **Security:** Security is a crucial aspect of OPC UA. It incorporates robust security measures to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity of data exchanged between devices and systems. OPC UA supports encryption, authentication, access control, and secure channel establishment to ensure secure communication in industrial networks.

5. **Platform Independence:** OPC UA is designed to be platform-independent, meaning it can run on different operating systems and hardware architectures. This flexibility allows OPC UA to be implemented in a wide range of devices, including sensors, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and enterprise systems.

6. **Services and Functionality:** OPC UA provides a rich set of services and functionality for various industrial automation scenarios. It supports services like data access, event subscriptions, method calls, historical data access, alarms, and more. These services enable real-time and historical data exchange, remote monitoring and control, and integration with higher-level enterprise systems.

7. **Scalability and Performance:** OPC UA is designed to handle large-scale industrial systems and networks. It offers features like publish-subscribe communication patterns, high-performance data access, and support for efficient data compression. These capabilities allow OPC UA to scale to meet the requirements of diverse industrial environments.

Overall, OPC UA is widely regarded as a robust and secure communication protocol for industrial automation. Its flexibility, interoperability, and standardized approach make it a preferred choice for integrating diverse devices, systems, and applications in industrial settings.

## .Net Stack

The Standard .NET OPC UA Stack is a software framework developed by the OPC Foundation for implementing OPC UA client and server applications using the .NET platform. It provides a set of libraries and tools that enable developers to build OPC UA compliant applications in the .NET environment. The Standard .NET OPC UA Stack and open62541 are both implementations of the OPC UA protocol stack, but they differ in terms of their programming language, platform compatibility, and specific features.

## Difference Between .Net Stack and open62541
Here are some key points highlighting the differences between the Standard .NET OPC UA Stack and open62541:

1. **Programming Language:** The Standard .NET OPC UA Stack is implemented in C# and is specifically designed for the .NET platform, leveraging the features and capabilities of the .NET framework. On the other hand, open62541 is implemented in C and can be used on a broader range of platforms, including those that do not have native support for the .NET framework.

2. **Platform Compatibility:** The Standard .NET OPC UA Stack is primarily intended for use with the .NET framework and is well-suited for developing OPC UA applications on Windows-based systems. It provides seamless integration with other .NET technologies and tools. In contrast, open62541 is designed to be platform-independent and can be used on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and others.

3. **Features and Functionality:** Both implementations strive to comply with the OPC UA specifications defined by the OPC Foundation. However, there may be some differences in terms of specific features and functionality offered by each stack. The Standard .NET OPC UA Stack provides a rich set of APIs and tools that align closely with the .NET framework, making it easier to develop OPC UA applications within the .NET ecosystem. open62541, being a C-based library, offers flexibility and customization options and can be used in a wide range of scenarios.

## Extending OPC UA Servers

When working with OPC UA servers, it is possible to create an extended server that inherits the nodes and parameters from another OPC UA server while introducing additional sets of nodes and parameters. This allows for the customization and expansion of functionality based on specific requirements.

### Can an OPC UA server extend another server by adding new nodes and parameters?

Yes, it is possible to create an OPC UA server that extends another OPC UA server. By following server hierarchies and utilizing OPC UA's object-oriented models, an extended server can inherit the existing nodes and parameters from the base server while introducing new sets of nodes and parameters specific to the extended server.

### Handling requests for inherited and new nodes/parameters

To achieve the desired behavior where the extended server can provide data from the inherited server for common nodes/parameters and its own data for new nodes/parameters, the following steps can be implemented:

1. Handle requests for common nodes/parameters: When a client requests a common node or parameter that is inherited from the base server, the extended server acts as a proxy and forwards the request to the base server to retrieve the data.

2. Respond to requests for new nodes/parameters: When a client requests a node or parameter that is specific to the extended server and not available in the base server, the extended server can handle those requests directly by providing the data from its own implementation.

By implementing this logic, the extended OPC UA server seamlessly combines data from the inherited server and provides its own data for new nodes/parameters, delivering a unified and customized experience to OPC UA clients.

Please note that the implementation details may vary depending on the OPC UA stack or framework being used. The specific APIs, methods, and event handlers provided by the stack will determine how to handle requests and retrieve data from the base server or the extended server's own implementation.
