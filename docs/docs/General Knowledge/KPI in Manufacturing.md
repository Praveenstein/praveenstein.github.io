# KPI in Manufacturing

## Six Big Losses
The Six Big Losses are a key concept in Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). They represent the most common causes of efficiency loss in manufacturing. Here they are:

1. **Downtime Loss (Mapped to Availability in OEE)** 
    - **Breakdowns:** These are instances of equipment failure that result in unscheduled downtime. They can be caused by tooling failures, unplanned maintenance, equipment breakdown, etc.
    - **Setup and Adjustments:** This refers to the time taken to change over from one product variant to another. It includes setup and adjustment time during which the equipment is not operational.
    - **Idling and Small Stops:** These are minor stops or pauses in the production process that are usually less than 5 minutes and do not require maintenance personnel. They can be caused by issues like a blocked sensor or a minor jam.

2. **Speed Loss (Mapped to Performance in OEE)**
    - **Reduced Speed:** This refers to instances where the machinery is operating, but not at its optimal speed. This could be due to wear and tear, equipment issues, or sub-optimal operating conditions.

3. **Defect Loss (Mapped to Quality in OEE)**
    - **Startup Rejects:** These are defects that occur during the startup phase of production. When equipment is first started, it may take a while for it to operate correctly, resulting in defective output.
    - **Production Rejects:** These are defects that occur during steady-state production. Despite the equipment running as expected, there can still be quality losses due to factors like tool wear or process variation.
        - **Rework:** These are defects that can be rectified by some rework.
        - **Scrap:** These are defects that cannot be rectified and are scraped.

By identifying and targeting these Six Big Losses, manufacturers can significantly improve their OEE and overall productivity.
